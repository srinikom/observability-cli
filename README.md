This is a fork of a [now-archived repo.](https://github.com/postmanlabs/observability-cli) 

# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

The fastest and easiest way to understand your APIs.

Built for busy developer teams who don't have time to become experts in monitoring and observability, Akita makes it possible to quickly discover all your API endpoints, see which are slowest, and learn which have errors. No SDKs or code changes necessary.

  * **Get plug-and-play API monitoring.** Explore and share per-endpoint volume, latency, and errors. Set per-endpoint alerts.
  * **See API endpoints.** Automatically get a searchable map of your API endpoints in use. Explore by latency, errors, and usage. Export as OpenAPI specs.

Drop Akita into your system to understand your applicationâ€™s behavior, without having to instrument code or build your own dashboards.

We're in open beta and would love to have you try us out! [Create an account in the Akita App](https://app.akita.software/login?sign_up) to get started.

## About this repo
This is the open-source repository for the community version of our CLI, and is
intended for use with the Akita console. This community version of the CLI does
not include functionality for inferring types and data formats. This
functionality is available only in the `akita` binary that we distribute.

## Running this repo

### How to build
Running the following commands will generate the `akita-cli` binary:
1. Install [Go 1.18 or above](https://golang.org/doc/install). 
2. Install `libpcap`
    - For Homebrew on mac: `brew install libpcap`
    - For Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install libpcap-dev`
3. `make`


### How to test

1. Install [gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock): `go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen`
